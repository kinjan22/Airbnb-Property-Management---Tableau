# Airbnb Property Management Optimization

## Project Description:
This project aims to optimize rental strategies, enhance customer satisfaction, and maximize revenue for Airbnb property owners by analysing Airbnbâ€™s dataset. The analysis focuses on neighbourhood popularity, pricing trends, property type distribution, customer satisfaction, and host performance. Tableau is used for creating interactive dashboards to provide actionable insights.

## Project Objectives:
1. Neighbourhood Popularity & Pricing:
*Identify high-demand areas and analyse pricing variations across locations.
*Understand the relationship between neighbourhood popularity and pricing.
*Property Type & Customer Satisfaction:
*Analyse the most demanded property types and booking trends over time.
*Assess the impact of instant booking availability and average stay duration.
*Understand customer satisfaction trends and their relationship with location.
2. Host & Listing Analysis:
*Compare pricing strategies of hosts with multiple listings.
*Measure the impact of service prices on overall listing costs.
*Correlate listing prices with customer reviews.
*Impact of Amenities on Pricing:
*Assess how amenities influence listing prices and booking patterns.

## Techniques Used:
1. Data Visualization (Tableau):
* Created interactive dashboards for popularity analysis, pricing distribution, and property type performance.
2. Correlation Analysis:
* Analysed relationships between service prices, customer reviews, and listing prices.
3. Comparative Analysis:
* Compared pricing trends, property types, and host performance across locations.
4. Trend Analysis:
* Identified booking trends over time and evaluated the impact of instant bookings.
  
## Key Insights:
* High-demand areas do not always have the highest prices, indicating potential opportunities for investment.
* Entire homes are the most popular property type, attracting longer stays (~9.8 days).
* Service price strongly impacts property prices, but higher prices do not always result in better reviews.
* Customer satisfaction is consistent across locations, suggesting factors other than location drive ratings.
  
## Conclusion:
The analysis provides actionable insights to optimize property listings, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance revenue generation. By leveraging these findings, Airbnb managers can make informed decisions to improve rental strategies.
